"""
In this exercise you will write a program that detects repeated words in a text file. When a repeated word is found your program should display a message that contains the line number and the repeated word.

 Ensure that your program correctly handles the case where the same word appears at the end of one line and the beginning of the following line, as shown in the previous example. 
 
 The name of the file to examine will be provided as the programâ€™s only command line argument."""
